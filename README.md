# Grayscale Image Converter (C + x86-64 Assembly)

This project converts an integer-based grayscale image (0‚Äì255) into a single-precision float-based grayscale image (0.0‚Äì1.0) using SIMD scalar instructions in x86-64 Assembly. It demonstrates C-to-Assembly function calling and data type conversion.

# üìä Performance Comparison: C vs Assembly

By contrasting a C implementation with x86-64 Assembly, the performance of grayscale conversion is assessed. Utilizing the clock() function, the main metric is the average execution time over a number of iterations (eg. 30).

üîÅ Setup
- Input: A m√ón matrix of int pixel values (0‚Äì255)
- Output: A m√ón matrix of float pixel values (0.0‚Äì1.0)
- Iterations: Each stage is executed 30 times to reduce runtime noise.
- Platform: Measured by using <time.h> to measure the CPU's wall-clock time.

üß™ Measured Functions

imgCvtGrayInttoFloat(): A C function that uses a loop to convert data to grayscale:
```bash
floatPixels[i] = (float)intPixels[i] / 255.0f
```
imgCvtGrayInttoFloat():
The x86-64 Assembly implementation uses scalar SIMD instructions:
  - CVTSI2SS: Converts a 32-bit integer to a scalar single-precision float
  - DIVSS: Performs scalar float division (by 255.0f)
  - Registers like xmm0‚Äìxmm1 are used

‚ö†Ô∏è Can Both Execution Times Sometimes Be Zero?

In our performance test runs, both the C and Assembly versions often report average execution times of:
```bash
  C Version     : 0.00000000 seconds  
  Assembly      : 0.00000000 seconds
```
The results do not suggest that the speeds of the two implementations are the same. Rather, this finding underscores the limitations of our benchmarking setup and is expected due to the following factors:
1. üßÆ Very Small Input Size - There are just 12 pixels in the test image, and they are grouped in a 3x4 matrix. Each function's completion time is frequently too short to be precisely assessed in nanoseconds because the clock() function's resolution normally runs in milliseconds.

2. üõ†Ô∏è Modern Compiler Optimizations - When flags are used, the performance of handwritten Assembly for this basic task is almost equal to that of the C compiler. This is due to its capacity to produce effective machine instructions, reduce arithmetic overhead, and inline the grayscale loop.

3. ‚è±Ô∏è Wall-Clock Granularity Limits - The <time.h> library's clock() function, which measures CPU time with a low level of detail, is used in our timing strategy. The reported zero values are explained by the clock's insufficient granularity for fast operations.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Install the required tools using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install nasm
brew install gcc
```

### Step 2: Check Terminal Architecture

Ensure your terminal is running under x86_64 architecture:

```bash
arch -x86_64 /System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal
uname -m  # Should output: x86_64
```

### Step 3: Create and Run the Compilation Script
#### 3.1) Create the shell script:

```bash
nano compile.sh
```

#### 3.2) Copy the following script content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
nasm -f macho64 convert.asm -o convert.o
clang -target x86_64-apple-macos11 -c main.c -o main.o -std=c99
clang -target x86_64-apple-macos11 main.o convert.o -o grayscale
./grayscale
```

Save and exit 

#### 3.3) Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x compile.sh
```

#### 3.4) Run the script:

```bash
./compile.sh
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Platform-Specific Assembly Considerations

### Register Usage Differences

Both macOS and Windows can run on x86-64 CPUs, but they differ in the organization of registers for function calls:

| Argument # | macOS/Linux | Windows |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| 1          | RDI         | RCX     |
| 2          | RSI         | RDX     |
| 3          | RDX         | R8      |
| 4          | RCX         | R9      |
| 5+         | Stack       | Stack   |
| Return     | RAX         | RAX     |

### Function Naming Conventions

**macOS:** Function names in assembly require a leading underscore (e.g., `_imgCvtGrayInttoFloat`) due to conventions from older linkers like Mach-O. This is different from Windows and Linux, where function names are typically not prefixed. The underscore helps the macOS linker find the correct function during the linking phase.

**Windows:** Function names do not require a leading underscore in the assembly code.
